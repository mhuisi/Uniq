	abstract = {Work to date on combining linear types and dependent types has deliberately and successfully avoided doing so. Entirely ﬁt for their own purposes, such systems wisely insist that types depend only on the replicable sublanguage, thus sidestepping the issue of counting uses of limited-use data either within types or in ways which are only really needed to shut the typechecker up. As a result, the linear implication (‘lollipop’) stubbornly remains a non-dependent S T . This paper deﬁnes and establishes the basic metatheory of a type theory supporting a ‘dependent lollipop’ (x : S) T [x], where what the input used to be is in some way commemorated by the type of the output. For example, we might convert list to length-indexed vectors in place by a function with type (l : List X) Vector X (length l). Usage is tracked with resource annotations belonging to an arbitrary rig, or ‘riNg without Negation’. The key insight is to use the rig’s zero to mark information in contexts which is present for purposes of contemplation rather than consumption, like a meal we remember fondly but cannot eat twice. We need no runtime copies of l to form the above vector type. We can have plenty of nothing with no additional runtime resource, and nothing is plenty for the construction of dependent types.},

	abstract = {Dependent types allow us to express precisely what a function is intended to do. Recent work on Quantitative Type Theory (QTT) extends dependent type systems with linearity, also allowing precision in expressing when a function can run. This is promising, because it suggests the ability to design and reason about resource usage protocols, such as we might find in distributed and concurrent programming, where the state of a communication channel changes throughout program execution. As yet, however, there has not been a full-scale programming language with which to experiment with these ideas. Idris 2 is a new version of the dependently typed language Idris, with a new core language based on QTT, supporting linear and dependent types. In this paper, we introduce Idris 2, and describe how QTT has influenced its design. We give examples of the benefits of QTT in practice including: expressing which data is erased at run time, at the type level; and, resource tracking in the type system leading to type-safe concurrent programming with session types.},

We present Graded Modal Dependent Type Theory (GrTT for short), which equips a dependent type theory with a general, parameterizable analysis of the flow of data, both in and between computational terms and types. In this theory, it is possible to study, restrict, and reason about data use in programs and types, enabling, for example, parametric quantifiers and linearity to be captured in a dependent setting. We propose GrTT, study its metatheory, and explore various case studies of its use in reasoning about programs and studying other type theories. We have implemented the theory and highlight the interesting details, including showing an application of grading to optimising the type checking procedure itself.},

	abstract = {Substructural type systems are growing in popularity because they allow for a resourceful interpretation of data which can be used to rule out various software bugs. Indeed, substructurality is ﬁnally taking hold in modern programming; Haskell now has linear types roughly based on Girard’s linear logic but integrated via graded function arrows, Clean has uniqueness types designed to ensure that values have at most a single reference to them, and Rust has an intricate ownership system for guaranteeing memory safety. But despite this broad range of resourceful type systems, there is comparatively little understanding of their relative strengths and weaknesses or whether their underlying frameworks can be uniﬁed. There is often confusion about whether linearity and uniqueness are essentially the same, or are instead ‘dual’ to one another, or somewhere in between. This paper formalises the relationship between these two well-studied but rarely contrasted ideas, building on two distinct bodies of literature, showing that it is possible and advantageous to have both linear and unique types in the same type system. We study the guarantees of the resulting system and provide a practical implementation in the graded modal setting of the Granule language, adding a third kind of modality alongside coeﬀect and eﬀect modalities. We then demonstrate via a benchmark that our implementation beneﬁts from expected eﬃciency gains enabled by adding uniqueness to a language that already has a linear basis.},

We leverage Rust's rich region-based type system to eliminate memory reasoning for many Rust programs, as long as they do not rely on interior mutability or unsafe code. Doing so, we relieve the proof engineer of the burden of memory-based reasoning, allowing them to instead focus on functional properties of their code. Our first contribution is a new approach to borrows and controlled aliasing. We propose a pure, functional semantics for LLBC, a Low-Level Borrow Calculus that captures a large subset of Rust programs. Our semantics is value-based, meaning there is no notion of memory, addresses or pointer arithmetic. Our semantics is also ownership-centric, meaning that we enforce soundness of borrows via a semantic criterion based on loans rather than through a syntactic type-based lifetime discipline. We claim that our semantics captures the essence of the borrow mechanism rather than its current implementation in the Rust compiler. Our second contribution is a translation from LLBC to a pure lambda-calculus. This allows the user to reason about the original Rust program through the theorem prover of their choice. To deal with the well-known technical difficulty of terminating a borrow, we rely on a novel approach, in which we approximate the borrow graph in the presence of function calls. This in turn allows us to perform the translation using a new technical device called backward functions. We implement our toolchain in a mixture of Rust and OCaml. Our evaluation shows significant gains of verification productivity for the programmer. Rust goes to great lengths to enforce static control of aliasing; the proof engineer should not waste any time on memory reasoning when so much already comes "for free"!},

Memory reasoning in SMT verification typically requires a nontrivial amount of manual effort to specify heap invariants, as well as extensive alias reasoning from the SMT solver. In this paper, we present a hybrid approach that combines linear types with SMT-based verification for memory reasoning. We integrate linear types into Dafny, a verification language with an SMT backend, and show that the two approaches complement each other. By separating memory reasoning from verification conditions, linear types reduce the SMT solving time. At the same time, the expressiveness of SMT queries extends the flexibility of the linear type system. In particular, it allows our linear type system to easily and correctly mix linear and nonlinear data in novel ways, encapsulating linear data inside nonlinear data and vice-versa. We formalize the core of our extensions, prove soundness, and provide algorithms for linear type checking. We evaluate our approach by converting the implementation of a verified storage system (about 24K lines of code and proof) written in Dafny, to use our extended Dafny. The resulting system uses linear types for 91\% of the code and SMT-based heap reasoning for the remaining 9\%. We show that the converted system has 28\% fewer lines of proofs and 30\% shorter verification time overall. We discuss the development overhead in the original system due to SMT-based heap reasoning and highlight the improved developer experience when using linear types.},

            This paper presents a framework aimed at significantly reducing the cost of proving functional correctness for low-level operating systems components. The framework is designed around a new functional programming language, Cogent. A central aspect of the language is its uniqueness type system, which eliminates the need for a trusted runtime or garbage collector while still guaranteeing memory safety, a crucial property for safety and security. Moreover, it allows us to assign two semantics to the language: The first semantics is imperative, suitable for efficient C code generation, and the second is purely functional, providing a user-friendly interface for equational reasoning and verification of higher-level correctness properties. The refinement theorem connecting the two semantics allows the compiler to produce a proof via translation validation certifying the correctness of the generated C code with respect to the semantics of the Cogent source program. We have demonstrated the effectiveness of our framework for implementation and for verification through two file system implementations.},

But linear schemes are restrictive in practice, and more restrictive than necessary to guarantee soundness of in-place update. This has prompted research into static analysis and more sophisticated typing disciplines, to determine when in-place update may be safely used, or to combine linear and non-linear schemes. Here we contribute to this line of research by deﬁning a new typing scheme which better approximates the semantic property of soundness of in-place update for a functional semantics. Our typing scheme includes two kinds of products (⊗ and ×), which allows data structures with or without sharing to be deﬁned. We begin from the observation that some data is used only in a “read-only” context after which it may be safely re-used before being destroyed. Formalizing the inplace update interpretation and giving a machine model semantics allows us to reﬁne this observation. We deﬁne three usage aspects apparent from the semantics, which are used to annotate function argument types. The aspects are (1) used destructively, (2) used read-only but shared with result, and (3) used read-only and not shared.},

	abstract = {Linear types (types of values that can be used just once) have been drawing a great deal of attention because they are useful for memory management, in-place update of data structures, etc.: an obvious advantage is that a value of a linear type can be immediately deallocated after being used. However, the linear types have not been applied so widely in practice, probably because linear values (values of linear types) in the traditional sense do not so often appear in actual programs. In order to increase the applicability of linear types, we relax the condition of linearity by extending the types with information on an evaluation order and simple dataflow information. The extended type system, called a quasi-linear type system, is formalized and its correctness is proved. We have implemented a prototype type inference system for the core-ML that can automatically find out which value is linear in the relaxed sense. Promising results were obtained from preliminary experiments with the prototype system.},

A potential disadvantage of this approach is that it places read accesses to such variables under the same restriction as write accesses, and thus prevents reads to proceed in parallel. We present here an extcnsion of linear types which augments the usual distinction between linear and non-linear by a third state, observers of linear variables. Since, unlike linear variables, observers can be duplicated, multiple concurrent reads are made possible. On the other hand, observers must be short-lived enough to never overlap with mutations. The resulting type system is in many aspects similar to the one of ML: It is polymorphic, has principal types, and admits a type reconstruction algorithm.},

When declaring resources such as file handles and manually managed memory as linear arguments, a linear type system can verify that these resources are used safely. However, writing code with explicit linear arguments requires bureaucracy. This paper presents linear constraints, a front-end feature for linear typing that decreases the bureaucracy of working with linear types. Linear constraints are implicit linear arguments that are filled in automatically by the compiler. We present linear constraints as a qualified type system, together with an inference algorithm which extends ghc’s existing constraint solver algorithm. Soundness of linear constraints is ensured by the fact that they desugar into Linear Haskell.

On the other hand, having an exact reference count of each value can enable optimizations, such as destructive updates. We explore these optimization opportunities in the context of an eager, purely functional programming language. We propose a new mechanism for efficiently reclaiming memory used by nonshared values, reducing stress on the global memory allocator. We describe an approach for minimizing the number of reference counts updates using borrowed references and a heuristic for automatically inferring borrow annotations. We implemented all these techniques in a new compiler for an eager and purely functional programming language with support for multi-threading. Our preliminary experimental results demonstrate our approach is competitive and often outperforms state-of-the-art compilers.},

	abstract = {This thesis is a presentation of dependent type theory with inductive types, a hierarchy of universes, with an impredicative universe of propositions, proof irrelevance, and subsingleton elimination, along with axioms for propositional extensionality, quotient types, and the axiom of choice. This
theory is notable for being the axiomatic framework of the Lean theorem prover. The axiom system is given here in complete detail, including “optional” features of the type system such as let binders and definitions. We provide a reduction of the theory to a finitely axiomatized fragment utilizing a fixed set of inductive types (the W-type plus a few others), to ease the study of this framework.
The metatheory of this theory (which we will call Lean) is studied. In particular, we prove unique typing of the definitional equality, and use this to construct the expected set-theoretic model, from
which we derive consistency of Lean relative to ZFC + \{there are n inaccessible cardinals {\textbar} n {\textless} ω\} (a relatively weak large cardinal assumption). As Lean supports models of ZFC with n inaccessible
cardinals, this is optimal.
We also show a number of negative results, where the theory is less nice than we would like. In particular, type checking is undecidable, and the type checking as implemented by the Lean theorem prover is a decidable non-transitive underapproximation of the typing judgment. Nontransitivity also leads to lack of subject reduction, and the reduction relation does not satisfy the
Church-Rosser property, so reduction to a normal form does not produce a decision procedure for definitional equality. However, a modified reduction relation allows us to restore the Church-Rosser
property at the expense of guaranteed termination, so that unique typing is shown to hold.},

Most ITPs support such extensions in the form of restrictive "syntax sugar" substitutions and other ad hoc mechanisms, which are too rudimentary to support many desirable abstractions. As a result, libraries are littered with unnecessary redundancy. Tactic languages in these systems are plagued by a seemingly unrelated issue: accidental name capture, which often produces unexpected and counterintuitive behavior. We take ideas from the Scheme family of programming languages and solve these two problems simultaneously by proposing a novel hygienic macro system custom-built for ITPs. We further describe how our approach can be extended to cover type-directed macro expansion resulting in a single, uniform system offering multiple abstraction levels that range from supporting simplest syntax sugars to elaboration of formerly baked-in syntax. We have implemented our new macro system and integrated it into the new version of the Lean theorem prover, Lean 4. Despite its expressivity, the macro system is simple enough that it can easily be integrated into other systems.},

	abstract = {KAZUTAKA MATSUDA, Tohoku University, Japan MENG WANG, University of Bristol, United Kingdom Invertibility is a fundamental concept in computer science, with various manifestations in software development (serializer/deserializer, parser/printer, redo/undo, compressor/decompressor, and so on). Full invertibility necessarily requires bijectivity, but the direct approach of composing bijective functions to develop invertible programs is too restrictive to be useful. In this paper, we take a different approach by focusing on partiallyinvertible functionsÐfunctions that become invertible if some of their arguments are fixed. The simplest example of such is addition, which becomes invertible when fixing one of the operands. More involved examples include entropy-based compression methods (e.g., Huffman coding), which carry the occurrence frequency of input symbols (in certain formats such as Huffman tree), and fixing this frequency information makes the compression methods invertible. We develop a language Sparcl for programming such functions in a natural way, where partial-invertibility is the norm and bijectivity is a special case, hence gaining significant expressiveness without compromising correctness. The challenge in designing such a language is to allow ordinary programming (the łpartiallyž part) to interact with the invertible part freely, and yet guarantee invertibility by construction. The language Sparcl is linear-typed, and has a type constructor to distinguish data that are subject to invertible computation and those that are not. We present the syntax, type system, and semantics of the language, and prove that Sparcl correctly guarantees invertibility for its programs. We demonstrate the expressiveness of Sparcl with examples including tree rebuilding from preorder and inorder traversals and Huffman coding.

To offer the expressiveness of Girard's linear logic while keeping the type system light and convenient, Alms uses expressive kinds that minimize notation while maximizing polymorphism between affine and unlimited types. A key feature of Alms is the ability to introduce abstract affine types via ML-style signature ascription. In Alms, an interface can impose stiffer resource usage restrictions than the principal usage restrictions of its implementation. This form of sealing allows the type system to naturally and directly express a variety of resource management protocols from special-purpose type systems. We present two pieces of evidence to demonstrate the validity of our design goals. First, we introduce a prototype implementation of Alms and discuss our experience programming in the language. Second, we establish the soundness of the core language. We also use the core model to prove a principal kinding theorem.},

In this paper, we study a linear type system designed with two crucial properties in mind: backwards-compatibility and code reuse across linear and non-linear users of a library. Only then can the benefits of linear types permeate conventional functional programming. Rather than bifurcate types into linear and non-linear counterparts, we instead attach linearity to function arrows. Linear functions can receive inputs from linearly-bound values, but can also operate over unrestricted, regular values. To demonstrate the efficacy of our linear type system - both how easy it can be integrated in an existing language implementation and how streamlined it makes it to write programs with linear types - we implemented our type system in GHC, the leading Haskell compiler, and demonstrate two kinds of applications of linear types: mutable data with pure interfaces; and enforcing protocols in I/O-performing functions.},

At the heart of the argument that this enables programmers to build more reliable and efficient software is the borrow checker - a novel approach to ownership that aims to balance type system expressivity with usability. And yet, to date there is no core type system that captures Rust's notion of ownership and borrowing, and hence no foundation for research on Rust to build upon. In this work, we set out to capture the essence of this model of ownership by developing a type systems account of Rust's borrow checker. We present Oxide, a formalized programming language close to source-level Rust (but with fully-annotated types). This presentation takes a new view of lifetimes as an approximation of the provenances of references, and our type system is able to automatically compute this information through a substructural typing judgment. We provide the first syntactic proof of type safety for borrow checking using progress and preservation. Oxide is a simpler formulation of borrow checking - including recent features such as non-lexical lifetimes - that we hope researchers will be able to use as the basis for work on Rust.},

	abstract = {The linear logic of J.-Y. Girard suggests a new type system for functional languages, one which supports operations that {\textbackslash}change the world". Values belonging to a linear type must be used exactly once: like the world, they cannot be duplicated or destroyed. Such values require no reference counting or garbage collection , and safely admit destructive array update. Linear types extend Schmidt's notion of single threading; provide an alternative to Hudak and Bloss' update analysis; and ooer a practical complement to Lafont and Holmstrr om's elegant linear languages. An old canard against functional languages is that they cannot change the world: they do not {\textbackslash}naturally" cope with changes of state, such as altering a location in memory, changing a pixel on a display, or sensing when a key is pressed. As a prototypical example of this, consider the world as an array. An array (of type Arr) is a mapping from indices (of type Ix) to values (of type Val). For instance, the world might be a mapping of variable names to values, or le names to contents. At any time, we can do one of two things to the world: nd the value associated with an index, or update an index to be associated with a new value. Of course it is possible to model this functionally; we just use the two operations A program that interacts with the world might have the form main : Args ! Arr ! Arr; where the rst parameter is the list of arguments that make up the command line, the second parameter is the old world, and the result is the new world. An example of a program is main les a = update {\textbackslash}stdout" (concat lookup i a j i les]) a:},

	abstract = {In programming, some data acts as a resource (e.g., file handles, channels) subject to usage constraints. This poses a challenge to software correctness as most languages are agnostic to constraints on data. The approach of linear types provides a partial remedy, delineating data into resources to be used but never copied or discarded, and unconstrained values. Bounded Linear Logic provides a more fine-grained approach, quantifying non-linear use via an indexed-family of modalities. Recent work on coeffect types generalises this idea to graded comonads, providing type systems which can capture various program properties. Here, we propose the umbrella notion of graded modal types, encompassing coeffect types and dual notions of type-based effect reasoning via graded monads. In combination with linear and indexed types, we show that graded modal types provide an expressive type theory for quantitative program reasoning, advancing the reach of type systems to capture and verify a broader set of program properties. We demonstrate this approach via a type system embodied in a fully-fledged functional language called Granule, exploring various examples.},

In this paper we establish a Curry–Howard–Lambek equivalence between a form of uniqueness types and a ‘resource-sensitive’ logic. This logic is similar to intuitionistic linear logic, however the ∘ modality, which moderates the structural rules in the antecedent in the same way as !, is introduced via the dual ? rules. We discuss the categorical proof theory and models of this new logic, as well as its computational interpretation.},

First, in order to express efficient code inside the parallel constructs, we introduce a simple type system for in-place updates that ensures referential transparency and supports equational reasoning. Second, we furnish Futhark with parallel operators capable of expressing efficient strength-reduced code, along with their fusion rules. Third, we present a flattening transformation aimed at enhancing the degree of parallelism that (i) builds on loop interchange and distribution but uses higher-order reasoning rather than array-dependence analysis, and (ii) still allows further locality-of-reference optimisations. Finally, an evaluation on 16 benchmarks demonstrates the impact of the language and compiler features and shows application-level performance competitive with hand-written GPU code.},

	abstract = {Systems programming often requires the manipulation of resources like file handles, network connections, or dynamically allocated memory. Programmers need to follow certain protocols to handle these resources correctly. Violating these protocols causes bugs ranging from type mismatches over data races to use-after-free errors and memory leaks. These bugs often lead to security vulnerabilities. While statically typed programming languages guarantee type soundness and memory safety by design, most of them do not address issues arising from improper handling of resources. An important step towards handling resources is the adoption of linear and affine types that enforce single-threaded resource usage. However, the few languages supporting such types require heavy type annotations. We present Affe, an extension of ML that manages linearity and affinity properties using kinds and constrained types. In addition Affe supports the exclusive and shared borrowing of affine resources, inspired by features of Rust. Moreover, Affe retains the defining features of the ML family: it is an impure, strict, functional expression language with complete principal type inference and type abstraction. does not require any linearity annotations in expressions and supports common functional programming idioms.},

Unlike previous combinations of linear typing and functional programming, we compromise neither the linear side (for example, our linear values are first-class citizens of the language) nor the functional side (for example, we do not require duplicate definitions of compositions for linear and unrestricted functions). To do so, we must generalize abstraction and application to encompass both linear and unrestricted functions. We capture the typing of the generalized constructs with a novel use of qualified types. Our system maintains the metatheoretic properties of the theory of qualified types, including principal types and decidable type inference. Finally, we give a formal basis for our claims of expressiveness, by showing that evaluation respects linearity, and that our language is a conservative extension of existing functional calculi.},

	abstract = {Typestate reflects how the legal operations on imperative objects can change at runtime as their internal state changes. A typestate checker can statically ensure, for instance, that an object method is only called when the object is in a state for which the operation is well defined. Prior work has shown how modular typestate checking can be achieved thanks to access permissions and state guarantees. However, typestate was not treated as a primitive language concept: typestate checkers are an additional verification layer on top of an existing language. In contrast, a typestate-oriented programming (TSOP) language directly supports expressing typestates. For example, in the Plaid programming language, the typestate of an object directly corresponds to its class, and that class can change dynamically. Plaid objects have not only typestate-dependent interfaces but also typestate-dependent behaviors and runtime representations. This article lays foundations for TSOP by formalizing a nominal object-oriented language with mutable state that integrates typestate change and typestate checking as primitive concepts. We first describe a statically typed language—Featherweight Typestate (FT)—where the types of object references are augmented with access permissions and state guarantees. We describe a novel flow-sensitive permission-based type system for FT. Because static typestate checking is still too rigid for some applications, we then extend this language into a gradually typed language—Gradual Featherweight Typestate (GFT). This language extends the notion of gradual typing to account for typestate: gradual typestate checking seamlessly combines static and dynamic checking by automatically inserting runtime checks into programs. The gradual type system of GFT allows programmers to write dynamically safe code even when the static type checker can only partly verify it.},

Solvers based on SMT are used as back-end engines in model-checking applications such as bounded, interpolation-based, and predicate-abstraction-based model checking. After a brief illustration of these uses, we survey the predominant techniques for solving SMT problems with an emphasis on the lazy approach, in which a propositional satisfiability (SAT) solver is combined with one or more theory solvers. We discuss the architecture of a lazy SMT solver, give examples of theory solvers, show how to combine such solvers modularly, and mention several extensions of the lazy approach. We also briefly describe the eager approach in which the SMT problem is reduced to a SAT problem. Finally, we discuss how the basic framework for determining satisfiability can be extended with additional functionality such as producing models, proofs, unsatisfiable cores, and interpolants.},

Taking inspiration from recent work that reconstructs traditional aspects of programming languages in terms of a modal account of {\textbackslash}emph\{phase distinctions\}, we argue that the cost structure of programs motivates a phase distinction between \${\textbackslash}textit\{intension\}\$ and \${\textbackslash}textit\{extension\}\$. Armed with this technology, we contribute a synthetic account of cost structure as a computational effect in which cost-aware programs enjoy an internal noninterference property: input/output behavior cannot depend on cost. As a full-spectrum dependent type theory, \${\textbackslash}textbf\{calf\}\$ presents a unified language for programming and specification of both cost and behavior that can be integrated smoothly with existing mathematical libraries available in type theoretic proof assistants. We evaluate \${\textbackslash}textbf\{calf\}\$ as a general framework for cost analysis by implementing two fundamental techniques for algorithm analysis: the \${\textbackslash}textit\{method of recurrence relations\}\$ and \${\textbackslash}textit\{physicist's method for amortized analysis\}\$. We deploy these techniques on a variety of case studies: we prove a tight, closed bound for Euclid's algorithm, verify the amortized complexity of batched queues, and derive tight, closed bounds for the sequential and \${\textbackslash}textit\{parallel\}\$ complexity of merge sort, all fully mechanized in the Agda proof assistant. Lastly we substantiate the soundness of quantitative reasoning in \${\textbackslash}textbf\{calf\}\$ by means of a model construction.},
